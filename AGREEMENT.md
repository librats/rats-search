## 2. DESCRIPTION OF SOFTWARE

2.1. Rats Search is a peer-to-peer (P2P) search engine and BitTorrent client that:
   - Crawls and indexes torrents from the BitTorrent Distributed Hash Table (DHT) network;
   - Provides full-text search capabilities over indexed torrent metadata;
   - Enables downloading of content via the BitTorrent protocol;
   - Operates over decentralized P2P networks.

2.2. **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: The Software automatically discovers and indexes torrent metadata from the public DHT network. This process is automated and indiscriminate — the Software collects metadata from ANY torrents it encounters on the network without filtering, verification, or content review.

2.3. The Developers have NO CONTROL over:
   - What content is available on the BitTorrent network;
   - What torrents the DHT network contains;
   - The legality, accuracy, or appropriateness of indexed content;
   - The actions of other P2P network participants.
